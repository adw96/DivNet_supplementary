# DivNet_supplementary

This repository contains code to repeat the data analysis and simulations in Willis & Martin's manuscript `Estimating diversity in networked ecological communities`.

All the simulations were managed using the [simulator](https://github.com/jacobbien/simulator). If you haven't use the simulator before, I encourage you to read the documentation on the basic setup. It is amazing package for organising reproducible and thorough simulations.

Code detailing the data generating process, the methods to compare, and the evaluation procedures are contained in the folder `simulator_files`. Each simulation has its own `main.R` file.
